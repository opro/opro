# Permissions

Permissions give the user a way to control the scope of access that a client application has to their data. This is similar to how Facebook will ask users what actions an application can take on their behalf.

## Write Access

To perform any type of request other than a [GET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) request, your application must have `write` access from the user. Your application can request this permission with `scope` (see Request Scope below). By default all permissions will be requested.

<% end %>

## Request Scope

As a client application, you can request specific scopes while you are authorizing a user. If no scope is specified, all permissions will be requested. This is an example of an application with client id of `3234myClientId5678` specifying that they want `write` access for their app:


    <%= oauth_new_url(:client_id => "3234myClientId5678", :protocol => @protocol) + "&scope[]=write" %>


While authorizing your application a user can choose to grant or reject individual permissions.


## Available Permissions/Scopes

These are the available permissions you can request as a client application. If no scope is provided, all permissions will be requested.
